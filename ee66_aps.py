    ## Introduction


    This is a long lab, but it is all software. The entire lab is done in this marimo notebook.


    We use various positioning systems every day. The most commonly used such system is the [Global Positioning System (GPS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System). The navigation systems in cars, Google Maps, cell phones, and even rockets and spaceships all use GPS.


    In this lab, we are going to explore basic navigation systems and build our own. At the end of this lab, you will have written software (and tested it on real data) that can determine the location of a receiver in 2D space!

    ## Basic Principles of Operation
    GPS satellites broadcast a variety of measurements such as the satellite's position and velocity, as well as time, using a very precise clock. GPS receivers make use of the fact that light propagates at a known speed: $3\times 10^8 ms^{-1}$. A receiver can therefore compute its distance to the satellite by measuring how long it takes the GPS signal to travel from the satellite to the receiver, using the speed of light and the known time that the signal was broadcasted from the satellite.

    We will instead explore an Acoustic Positioning System, using speakers as signal emitters to emit sound (the signal), and using microphones as receivers. We can similarly determine the distance to each emitter based on the delay between the times at which we receive each signal. We will explore this idea further through the course of this lab.

    ## Overview

    The block diagram below describes the system at a high level.

    <br>

    First, each speaker transmits a unique signal. The combined signal from all speakers is then recorded by the microphone and converted to a format that is convenient for further processing.

    <br>

    Next, the component signal from each speaker is identified from the received total signal using cross-correlation analysis, and the corresponding time differences are used to determine the receiver's location.

    ## <font color="blue">Task 1: Measuring the Similarity of Two Signals


    Our APS setup will use multiple speakers as 'beacons' to emit signals, and a single microphone receiver. The receiver will receive the sum of all the emitted signals at various delays, depending on the relative distances between the speakers and microphone. To identify each speaker's emitted signal from the received signal, as well as the time delay associated with each component, we will use **cross-correlation** analysis. In particular, the combined received signal will be cross correlated with stored copies of **each** speaker's unique emitted signal.


    **[Cross-correlation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-correlation)** is a measure of similarity between two functions - in this case these 'functions' will be vectorized time domain signals. It is a mathematical operation defined by taking successive inner products as one vector 'slides past the other', roughly speaking. Intuitively this is a measure of the 'overlap' between two signals as one signal is shifted in time. For discrete signals, the 'overlap' at time $t$ of the received signal and a copy of a particular speaker generated signal is the inner product of the received signal at that time and a shifted version of the stored copy. Both a mathematical definition and an animation are shown below where $x$ and $y$ are real valued functions.


    You have learned how to calculate the linear cross-correlation between two generic signals. Recall that for two signals $x$ and $y$, the $m^{th}$ element of the linear cross-correlation vector $\vec{\rho_{xy}}$ is defined below:


    $$corr_{\vec{x}}(\vec{y})[m]=\vec{\rho_{xy}}[m] \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=} \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} x[n] y[n-m]$$

    $\rho_{xy}[m]$ is the inner product of two vectors that have been zero-padded: $\vec{x}[n]$ and $\vec{y}[n-m]$, where $m$ is an integer between $-\infty$ to $\infty$. $\vec{y}[n-m]$ is $\vec{y}$ delayed by $m$ discrete time steps. In the above animation, the red signal is shifted by various time steps. The value of the black signal at a particular time is the inner product of the shifted red signal at the corresponding time shift and the blue signal. Observe that the red signal has been zero-padded on both sides to match the length of the blue signal. The blue signal is also zero-padded such that the correlation vector (black) contains entries for all valid overlaps between the two signals.

    In this lab we will be using a variant of linear cross-correlation called **periodic linear cross-correlation**. The difference between finite linear cross-correlation and periodic cross-correlation is that <span style='color:red'><b> we treat the stationary signal as repeating infinitely in time.</b></span>  The original stationary signal is effectively padded with a copy of itself infinitely many times.

    ## <font color="blue">Task 2: Extracting Information


    The acoustic positioning system we will design uses speakers as *beacons* that each transmit a (known) unique *beacon signal*. The beacon signals will be used to determine the position of a *receiver* - a microphone. Figure 3a shows examples of waveforms generated by a two beacon system. The beacons are synchronized, i.e all beacon signals are transmitted from their respective beacons simultaneously. Figure 3b demonstrates an example of a  receiver that is further away from beacon 2 than beacon 1, consequently receiving the beacon signal from beacon 2 **after** the beacon signal from beacon 1.



    <img src="public/Slide2.tiff.png" width=700px></img>

    <h4><center>Figure 3</center></h4>


    The raw signal that the receiver measures shown in Figure 4a (black), is a superposition of beacon signal 1 and a delayed beacon signal 2. We can cross-correlate this received signal  with stored copies of each unique beacon signal to determine when each beacon signal arrived at the receiver. For a given beacon signal, this will be the time index that corresponds to the maximum cross-correlation with the stored copy of that particular beacon signal.


    <img src="public/Slide3.tiff.png" width=700px></img>

    <h4><center>Figure 4</center></h4>


    Notice that in Figure 4b, the cross-correlation of the received signal with a stored copy of beacon signal 1 attains its maximum 3 milliseconds **before** the cross-correlation of the received signal with beacon signal 2 is maximized. We can therefore infer that beacon signal 1 was received 3 milliseconds before beacon signal 2, and that the distance of the microphone from the first beacon is less than the distance of the microphone from the second beacon.


    Although the two beacon signals are different, notice that the cross-correlation **between the two beacon signals** is still non-zero. This is fine for our purposes, and will still allow for robust identification of beacon signals. In particular we only require that:


    * The cross-correlation **between different beacon signals** is **small**.

    * The cross-correlation of a beacon signal with itself (autocorrelation) is **small** for **non zero shifts**.

    * The autocorrelation of a beacon signal with itself is **large** at **zero shift**.


    If these conditions hold, we can still identify the beacon signals that a received signal is composed of, since the cross-correlation between a beacon signal and the received signal at the correct offset (i.e where the overlap between the beacon signal and the corresponding component in the received signal is maximized) will always be considerably larger than other cross-correlation values.


    Real Global Positioning Systems deal with this problem by using pseudorandom binary sequences (signals composed of just 1s and 0s), also known as **Gold Codes**, constructed with the three properties described above. The theory and implementation of these signals is beyond the scope of this class. We have provided a large set of Gold Codes that are designed to work well for our purposes — **these are exactly the beacon signals you'll be using for the rest of this lab.**


    Run the next cell to simulate three beacons that each produce a unique gold code.

def _(mo):

    Before moving on to converting between time delays and positions, you should first consider several potential issues with this model for a positioning system:

    1. The beacons play on a loop at a fixed rate. However, as the receiver is not synchronized with the rest of the beacons, we do not know when in the loop we started recording the beacon signals on the receiver. If we record for exactly the number of samples in one period of a beacon signal, we most likely started recording after some portion of the beacon signal has already been transmitted.
    <br/> <br/>
    It turns out that since our system uses periodic signals, it doesn't matter where we start. As long as we get all the information for at least one period, we can find the relative time delay within that period, and our system works!
    <br/> <br/>
    2. You may notice that the magnitude of the peaks in your cross-correlation output is dependent on the volume of the speakers. How might this affect the reliability of the positioning system?
    <br/> <br/>
    Recall that our system uses gold codes as beacon signals and the cross-correlation of different gold codes is small but non-zero. If the volumes of the speakers are within a reasonable range, these signals don't interfere with each other. The heights of the different peaks might change, but their identified positions won't.

        But, if the volumes of the speakers are far apart, these signals might interfere with each other, and the cross correlation with a loud speaker's signal might even exceed the autocorrelation at zero shift for a soft speaker.

        Thus, we should be able to identify the correct offsets for our beacon signals as long as the speaker volumes are within a reasonable range.
    <br/> <br/>
    3. Like any real world system, the output will be affected by noise.
    <br/> <br/>

    Issue 2 is mitigated by ensuring the physical setup has speaker volumes within a reasonable range.

    In order to mitigate issues 1 and 3 in our lab, the beacon signals repeat every **230 ms** and we record for approximately **2.5 s**. We are therefore recording multiple periods of the periodic beacon signal.

    # <span style="color:blue">Task 5: Computing Distances</span>

    Cross-correlation analysis allows us to determine the time delays (in units of samples) between the arrivals of different beacon signals at the receiver. We need to convert between these sample delays and physical distances. To do so, we must first be able to convert the sample delays to real values of time and then convert those to physical distances.

    As previously discussed, the beacons begin transmitting at an unknown time. However, we can compute arrival times relative to a particular **reference beacon**, treating this beacon as having arrived at $t=\tau_0$. **<span style="color:red">Note that $\tau_0$ is to be treated as an unknown in our system, which we'll address later.</span>**

    For example, we can choose **`beacon0`** to be the reference beacon. Then, the peak corresponding to **`beacon0`** is considered to be $t=\tau_0$. If the cross-correlation peak corresponding to **`beacon1`** occurs 300 samples after the **`beacon0`**, we can conclude that **`beacon1`** was received at $t=\tau_0 + 300$.

    The relative times of arrival (in units of samples) which we will call **offsets** are all defined  **offset** with respect to **`beacon0`** (or any other beacon of our choice). You can then convert offsets in samples to time delays in seconds at a known sampling frequency $f$ (this frequency determines the duration in seconds of each discrete time interval $T$). We'll abbreviate these time delays as TDOAs (time delays of arrival). More formally, if we denote each beacon's **absolute** time of arrival as $\tau_m$, each beacon's **TDOA** will be $\Delta \tau_m = \tau_m - \tau_0$.<br><br>

    Suppose we have $M$ beacons $\vec{a}_0,~\vec{a}_1,~\cdots,~\vec{a}_{M - 1}$, so the position of a beacon $\vec{a}_i$ in the 2-D plane will be $\vec{a}_i = [a_{i,x}, a_{i ,y}]^T$. These positions are known. We also have a receiver $\vec{r}$ with unknown position $\vec{r}=[r_x, r_y]^T$ in the same plane. Let $d_i$ denote the distance of $a_i$ to $\vec{r}$, $d_i = \sqrt{(r_x - a_{i, x})^2 + (r_y - a_{i, y})^2}$.

    For simplification, in this lab we set the zeroth beacon $\vec{a}_0$ at position (0, 0), as a reference. We also let $\tau_0$, $\tau_1$ ... $\tau_{m - 1}$ denote the absolute times of arrival. Since we are referencing all the beacons to the zeroth beacon, we also define the TDOAs $\Delta\tau_i = \tau_i - \tau_0$.

    In Task 5, you wrote a function that allows you to determine the TDOAs from the signal recorded by the receiver. We need the absolute times of arrival to determine the distance from each beacon to the receiver. As such, we need to treat $\tau_0$ as an unknown.

    From $M$ number of beacons, we have $M$ equations for $0\leq i<M$:
    $$\Vert \vec{r}- a_i \Vert ^2 = d_i^2$$

    Expanding the norm, and substituting for $d_i=v_s\tau_i$ where $v_s$ is the speed of sound, we get:

    $$ \Vert \vec{r} \Vert^2 - 2\vec{a}_i^T\vec{r} + \Vert \vec{a}_i \Vert^2 = v_s^2\tau_i^2 $$

    We can get rid of the quadratic term $\Vert \vec{r} \Vert^2$ by subracting each $i^\mathrm{th}$ equation with the zeroth equation ($i=0$):

    $$ 2(\vec{a}_0-\vec{a}_i)^T\vec{r} = \Vert \vec{a}_0 \Vert^2 - \Vert \vec{a}_i \Vert^2 + v_s^2(\tau_i^2-\tau_0^2) $$

    Expanding $(\tau_i^2-\tau_0^2) =  (\tau_i-\tau_0)(\tau_i+\tau_0)  =  (\tau_i-\tau_0)(\tau_i-\tau_0+2\tau_0) = \Delta\tau_i (\Delta \tau_i + 2\tau_0)$ we express the argument in terms of the measured time differences $\Delta \tau_i$ and the unknown $\tau_0$, and get:

    $$ 2(\vec{a}_0-\vec{a}_i)^T\vec{r} = \Vert \vec{a}_0 \Vert^2 - \Vert \vec{a}_i \Vert^2 + v_s^2\Delta \tau_i(\Delta \tau_i + 2\tau_0) $$

    Rearranging, we get a linear set of equation w.r.t $\vec{r}$ and $\tau_0$!

    $$ 2(\vec{a}_0-\vec{a}_i)^T\vec{r} - 2(v_s^2\Delta \tau_i)\tau_0 = \Vert \vec{a}_0 \Vert^2 - \Vert \vec{a}_i \Vert^2 + v_s^2\Delta \tau_i^2 $$

    And explicitly expanding the variables $r_x,~r_y,~\tau_0$, and substituting $\vec{a}_0 = [0,0]^T$:

    $$ -2a_{i,x}r_{x} - 2a_{i,y}r_y - 2(v_s^2\Delta \tau_i) \tau_0 = -a_{i,x}^2 - a_{i,y}^2 + v_s^2 \Delta \tau_i^2 $$

    Negating we get the final result

    $$ 2a_{i,x}r_{x} + 2a_{i,y}r_y + 2v_s^2\Delta \tau_i \tau_0 = a_{i,x}^2  +a_{i,y}^2 - v_s^2 \Delta \tau_i^2 $$

    which are M-1 equations (since we used equation i=0), for $1\leq i < M$.
